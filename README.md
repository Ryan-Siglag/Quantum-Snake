I researched quantum mechanics and made a video game based on a principal from the field of study. I focused on the wave function collapse of superpositions. This property of quantum mechanics describes how when a particle is in a superposition between several states, measuring its state will force the particle to collapse into one of these states. For my game, I took the classic game of Snake and reimagined it in a world where an object as large as an apple could exhibit quantum properties. This means that each apple in the game is in a superposition between a healthy apple and a rotten one. Therefore, when the snake goes to eat (measure) the apple, it has a 50% chance of becoming a healthy apple and a 50% chance of becoming a rotten one. When it is healthy, the snake eats the apple and grows in size like the original game. However, when it is rotten, the snake passes over it and the apple stays in its position, acting as a barrier for the rest of the game.
